## Link List  
This html creates a simple html page for your Hyperlinks.   
It provides a better overview about your hyperlinks than standard bookmakrs. Additionally you will see all your links repeatedly, 
so no more "What I don't see, I will forget it".

All you have to do is to add your link to the data.js file. The html page is then generated automatically

The data can be seperated to subjects ("Start", "Next") to provide better overview and with the nav bar you can add even more pages
